# Target.com 
It's a clone of Target.com
I had given an individual Project. So my project was to clone target.com Which is an American E-commerce Website where you can find everything from groceries to electronics. So, I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript to make this website. Html is used for the framework of this website, Beautification of this website is done with the help of CSS, For the functionality of this Website, I used javascript. My flow of this website is Homepage, sign in, signup, then when you click on the menu you landed on the product page, in product page each product have a button which I have added the functionality that whenever you can click on that button it will add to cart as well as increase the count the product number.
Also, I have added a feature of sorting based on the price.
On the cart page, You can check your product as well as your total price.on the payment side, you can check your total, and also you can use my promo code “pushpendra21” you can have a 21% discount on the total price. 
After clicking on checkout you will be redirected to the payment page after payment you can then see a confirmation alert on the top of the page after some time you will redirect to the homepage of this website.
In this project, I have learned a lot of this thing such as how to use your time management and also learned how to maintain a GitHub repo.
Also, I faced a lot of problems like while adding functionality to the website at the very last moment the functionality didn’t work so it took my entire whole day to debug this. But at last, the Website worked.
